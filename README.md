# **Yrian Derreumaux Portfolio**

My portfolio consists primarily of research projects that have been published in psychology journals during my PhD at the University of California, Riverside.

## Computational underpinnings of partisan information processing biases and associations with depth of cognitive reasoning (Cognition 2023)
* Summary: To what extent do partisan disagreements over basic facts reflect prior beliefs versus motivated reasoning? This project uses drift diffusion modeling to isolate the unique influence of each source of bias in evaluations of the honest of political candidates.

## Stereotypes disrupt probabilistic category learning (Journal of Experimental Psychology 2023)
* Summary: How do stereotypes disrupt how people learn new associations? This project uses a probabilistic cateogry learning task to examine how social information disrupts the acquisition of new association. [The task](https://github.com/yrianderreumaux/JS-Prediction-Task) was build using javascript and we use generalized linear models and reinforcement learning to model behavior

## Partisan-motivated sampling: Re-examining politically motivated reasoning across the information processing stream (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology)
* Summary: This project examines an important component often neglected in studies of motivated reasoning: Where and how much information people gather before updating their beliefs. We show that biases in how people gather information (e.g., sampling first and most often from their own group) give rise to more variable experiences that people then selectively integrate into their beliefs.
